## Overview
The Java Banking App Management System is a console-based application designed to simulate basic banking operations. It allows users to perform various banking tasks such as money transfers, balance inquiries, utility bill payments, and managing ATM security settings. This project demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts and object-oriented design principles.
## Features
### Main Features
Authentication: Users are required to enter a PIN to access the banking functionalities.
Main Menu: Once authenticated, users are presented with a menu to choose from various banking operations:
Send Money: Transfer funds to another account.
Request Money: Request funds from another account.
Check Balance: View current account balance.
ATM Security Settings: Change PIN or lock ATM card.
Download Transaction History: Download transaction records.
Pay Utility Bill: Pay bills such as electricity, education, or internet.
Modular Design: The application is structured into classes and methods, ensuring clear separation of concerns and promoting code reusability.
Input Validation: User inputs are validated to ensure proper functionality and prevent errors.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented to manage unexpected inputs or scenarios.
Additional Details
PIN and Account Management: Users can change their PIN and manage ATM card security settings for added flexibility and security.
Utility Bill Payments: Users can pay utility bills directly through the application, reducing the need for additional transactions.
Transaction History: Provides users with the option to download their transaction history for financial record-keeping.
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in Java programming, particularly in:
Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Handling user input and implementing console-based user interfaces.
Basic control flow and decision-making using loops and conditionals.
File structure and organization of Java projects.
## How It Was Made
This project was developed entirely in Java using IntelliJ IDEA as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Key steps involved in its creation include:
Planning: Defined the project scope, identified required functionalities, and outlined class structures and methods.
Implementation: Implemented the core functionalities such as authentication, menu navigation, banking operations, and input validation.
Testing: Conducted iterative testing to ensure each feature worked as intended, addressed edge cases, and refined user interactions.
Refinement: Refactored code to improve readability, optimize performance, and enhance error handling.
## Getting Started
To run the Java Banking App Management System:
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
Compile and run the BankingApp.java file.
Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the application.
## Future Improvements
Future enhancements to consider for this project include:
Adding multi-user support with account creation and management.
Implementing a more robust error handling mechanism.
Enhancing the user interface with a graphical interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing.
